imReadAndConvert-
 Reads an image, and returns the image converted as requested (gray or rgb)

imDisplay-
 Reads an image as RGB or GRAY_SCALE and displays it

transformRGB2YIQ-
Converts an RGB image to YIQ color space by multiplex the image at the matrix:
    [0.299, 0.587, 0.114],
    [0.596, -0.275, -0.321],
    [0.212, -0.523, 0.311]]


transformYIQ2RGB-
Converts an YIQ image to RGB color space by multiplex the image at the reverse matrix:
    [0.299, 0.587, 0.114],
    [0.596, -0.275, -0.321],
    [0.212, -0.523, 0.311]]


hsitogramEqualize-
Equalizes the histogram of an image.
The function return imgEq, histOrg, histEQ bt the steps:
transform to yiq (for rgb format)
Calculate the normalized
Calculate the image histogram
Calculate the normalized Cumulative Sum (CumSum)
Calculate the cumSum histogram


quantizeImage-
The function calculate quantize cy sending the pic to the function:
quantizeImage_gray or quantizeImage_rgb.
the function (to the right image) calculate quantize by the steps:
create image cumSum
add to list size of every interval (by the function finding Q)
find all limits (by the function finding Z)
add mse and quantize to final list (by the function: image_update that create new array with the updates colors, mse)
